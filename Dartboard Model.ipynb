    "2. Standard error equals to standard deviation divided by the sqrt(sample_size). To calculate it, I chose a fixed number of throws (1000) and drew samples of different sizes from 10 to 1000. I set the final approximation to be the mean of all the approximations in the sample. The resulting list of standard errors is added to the plt.errorbar() function which plots green standard error bars on the graph. Error bars depend on the sample size because the bigger this number is, the better our approximation gets. The graph below demonstrates this trend: the approximations of pi for small sample sizes are further from the real value of pi and have higher error bars. Regarding the asymptotic notation, the standard error has O(n^(−1/2)) (as we divide by the sqrt(n)) as n --> ∞."

The mean of a bigger number of approximations for a fixed sample size gives us a better approximation of the real value. Even if the number of throws is very low, we can repeat the simulation many times and, on average, the mean will be close to pi because the model is randomized (not biased) and, on average, it will produce higher estimates as often as lower estimates. \n",

    "    Another way to increase the accuracy, if the number of samples is fixed, is to increase the number of throws. As the number of throws approaches infinity, we get a far better estimate of the ratio of the circle area to the square area. If the number of throws is infinitely big, even a single run of the simulation will give us a very reliable, if not perfect, estimate of the actual number. However, as the computational power and time are limited, this is almost impossible in real life. "

    "5  To get one more decimal digit of accuracy we need to have a standard error which is 1/10 as large, which requires a 10^2-fold increase in computation. To get three more digits of accuracy requires 1000^2 times as much computation.  For example, if the researcher needs at least 10 digits, the standard error has to be less than 10^-10. As O(n^(-1/2)), n has to be larger than 10^20. I know that it takes my computer ≅0.09 sec to calculate the estimate when the number of throws is 10^5, so, by multiplying it by 10^15 I get 9*10^13 sec or approx. 3000000 years.
